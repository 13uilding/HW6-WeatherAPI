# HW6-WeatherAPI
++++About++++

This application was designed to help the user plan their time in different locations by providing them with a weather forecast for the next 5 days.
First, the application will ask for permission to use geolocation. If accepted, show the user their current location's forecast. Otherwise, display a form input for the user to enter their desired location
Second, when the user enters their desired location or press one of the cached locations, the website displays the 5 day forecast for that location.
Third, the application will store locations on the left of the page and in local stored for easy access in the future.
The application will utilize open weather API and google maps API to display forecast of the entered location.
